# jqLite

> WORK IN PROGRESS

**jqLite** is a simple vanillaJS library that aim to provide a simple interface for:

- Query the DOM.
- Ajax request.

Is based on the idea of [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [sizzle](https://github.com/jquery/sizzle) libraries that provides a very useful and simple way to manipulate the DOM, make ajax request,  cross browser compatibility, ...

**jqLite** doesn't pretend to substitue these libraries is only a way of learning more in depth how to build a library, DOM, Javascript patterns, how to apply **Clean Code principles** to Javascript, module patterns, ...
